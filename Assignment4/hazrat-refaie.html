                                    the lunar month of Rajab in district Hasen, in the Vasit province of Iraq. When he

                                    years old, his
                                    father Syed Sultan Ali passed away in Baghdad. From then on his maternal uncle Syed

                                    sons of Hazrat Ali (R.A). On the paternal side his lineage goes back to the Prophet

                                    (SAW).

                                    Ahmed Ar Refaie learned the Qur'an from Shaikh Abdus Sami al Hurbuni in Hasen, where
                                    he was
                                    born, and by the
                                    age of seven he had committed it all to memory. (The title Shaikh before a name
                                    indicates a sufi
                                    teacher.)
                                    That same year, after his father died, his maternal uncle Mansur ar Rabbani al
                                    Betaihi moved
                                    with his family
                                    to the region of Dikla. There he sent his nephew to Abul Fadl Ali al Vasiti, who was
                                    an expert
                                    in the canon
                                    law of Islam, a commentator on the Qur'an, and a great preacher.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In addition to attending the zikr meetings of his uncle Mansur ar Rabbani al
                                    Betaihi, Ahmed Ar
                                    Refaie also
                                    attended the courses of his other uncle, Shaikh Abubakar, who was a great scientist
                                    of his era
                                    and the
                                    sultan of scientists. He eventually memorized the book Tanbih, which deals with the
                                    fikh (Muslim
                                    canonical
                                    jurisprudence) of Imam Shafi according to Imam Abu Ishaq Shirazi, and wrote an
                                    explanation about
                                    the book.
                                    (This explanation was lost in the Mongol invasion.)
                                    <br><br>
                                    He occupied all his time with acquiring religious knowledge. Eventually even his own
                                    teachers
                                    and the people
                                    who taught him respect learned the essence of respect when they were in his
                                    presence.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When Ahmed Ar Refaie was twenty years old, Abul Fadl Ali al Vasiti, who was the
                                    Shaikh of Wasit
                                    province and
                                    his teacher, awarded him a sehadetname (teaching certificate) encompassing the
                                    sciences of canon
                                    law and
                                    permission to initiate a dervish order, gave him the name "father of external and
                                    interior
                                    sciences," and
                                    dressed him with his own dervish's cloak. His teachers and his shaikhs agreed about
                                    the
                                    greatness of his
                                    rank and the superiority of his worth.
                                    <br><br>
                                    He remained in Nehr-e-Dikla for a short time and after that went back to his
                                    father's guest
                                    house for
                                    travelers in Hasen. He then became very well known. When he was twenty-eight, his
                                    uncle Syed
                                    Mansur ar
                                    Rabbani al Betaihi requested that he led the dervish lodge and Caliphs after him. He
                                    also
                                    instructed him to
                                    live in the dervish lodge of Shaikh Yahya en-Naccari, who was his grandfather from
                                    his mother's
                                    side. Ahmed
                                    Ar Refaie took up his post (shaikhship) there as an enlightened master and began
                                    teaching in
                                    this dervish
                                    lodge. His uncle died in the same year. By the time Ahmed Ar Refaie reached the age
                                    of
                                    thirty-five, his
                                    murids (disciples) numbered over seven hundred thousand. He taught the Sunnah (the
                                    way of the

                                    Muhammad ) and the details of the Qur'an to the public, and he always said that "the
                                    trade of a
                                    wise man is
                                    to show the way that leads to Allah and to direct hearts towards Allah".
                                    <br><br>
                                    He held courses on Hadees, Islamic canon law, religious precepts, and commentary on
                                    the Qur'an
                                    on all days
                                    of the week except Mondays and Thursdays. He sat in his pulpit on Monday and
                                    Thursday afternoons
                                    and
                                    preached to intellectuals and the general public. Because of the depth and the
                                    influence of his
                                    words, the
                                    people were captivated, their intelligence was stupefied, and their hearts submitted
                                    to him.
                                    Apart from the
                                    Prophet Muhammad, the companions and disciples of the Prophet and twelve Imams,
                                    there was no
                                    other person
                                    who spoke as well as Ahmed Ar Refaie did.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Whenever he sat in his pulpit to give a lecture, crowds-including advanced
                                    scientists,
                                    preachers, spiritual
                                    teachers and the general public-gathered. When he began to speak, knowledge gushed
                                    out with his
                                    words like
                                    the gushing sea. Wise men were enraptured when they heard his beautiful and
                                    influential words
                                    and listened
                                    to his extensive knowledge. The denying and obstinate were tongue-tied in the
                                    presence of the
                                    power of the
                                    evidence. Literary men profited from his outstanding expression, scientists from his
                                    skills and
                                    talents and
                                    philosophers from his deep and wise manner of speaking.

                                    In his book Sevad-ul-Ainein, the writer Imam Rafii narrates, "Shaikh Salih Yusuf Abu
                                    Zakariya al
                                    Askalani,
                                    who was a great expert in the canon law of Islam, told me: 'I had gone to Umme Abida
                                    to visit
                                    Shaikh Ahmed
                                    Al Kabeer Ar Refaie'. There were more than one hundred thousand people around the
                                    guest house;
                                    some were
                                    managers, scientists and shaikhs, and the others were the normal public. He gave
                                    dinner to all
                                    of them and
                                    was very friendly to everyone. He started to preach in the afternoon of a Thursday.
                                    In the
                                    audience were
                                    preachers from the province of Vasit, as well as a religious community of doctors of
                                    Muslim
                                    theology of Iraq
                                    and the important people of the province. One group asked questions about the
                                    science of
                                    commentary on the
                                    Qur'an, another asked about subjects dealing with the recorded sayings of the
                                    Prophet Muhammad,
                                    another
                                    asked about Muslim canon jurisprudence, another asked about the disagreements
                                    between the
                                    different
                                    religious opinions, and yet another group asked many questions about different areas
                                    of science.
                                    Ahmed Ar
                                    Refaie answered more than two hundred questions, and he did not get angry when he
                                    was answering
                                    the
                                    questions. I became embarrassed because of the insensitivity of people asking the
                                    questions, and
                                    I stood up
                                    and said, 'Is this not enough for you? He can answer every question about the
                                    written sciences,
                                    without
                                    facing any difficulty, with the permission of Allah!' Ahmed Ar Refaie smiled at my
                                    words and
                                    said, 'Abu
                                    Zakariya, allow them to ask before I pass away. Certainly the world is a house from
                                    which we
                                    will all
                                    depart. Allah changes all situations, all of the time.' All the public cried at this
                                    answer. The
                                    crowd was
                                    perplexed and anxious exclamations were heard. Forty thousand people became his
                                    students because
                                    of the
                                    spiritual effect of his talk."
                                    <br><br>
                                    Ahmed Ar Refaie's talks, his actions, his behavior and his every breath were for
                                    Allah. He
                                    always had a
                                    smiling face, was modest and good-tempered, endured suffering, and was very patient.
                                    He did not
                                    get
                                    personally cross with anyone, and did not want any help for his own person. On the
                                    contrary, he
                                    loved for
                                    Allah, and even his anger was from Allah and for Allah. He did not rebuke anybody
                                    who behaved in
                                    a manner
                                    that he did not like. He considered neither his family nor himself superior to other
                                    people.
                                    Speaking about
                                    this he said, "According to our opinion of Allah, everybody is equal to everybody
                                    else: it
                                    doesn't matter if
                                    they are close relatives or if they are strangers to us."
